Improvements to the default Senaite COA templates following ISO 17025 (2017) guidelines

Some of the improvements here should rightfully be submitted to Senaite as it improves the generic tempplates. The add-on is sponsored by [Test It laboratory](https://www.testit-labs.co.za/) member of the [Bika Open Source Collective](https://www.bikalims.org/), coded by [Bika Lab Systems](https://www.bikalabs.com/), and not enough capacity exists to complete the procedure, hopefully sooner than later

Improvements include:

### Unique ID per COA

More than one COA may be issued for the same Samples, say for provisional publication of early results and republication when all results are available. For this reason COA’s must have unique IDs to refer to them correctly

COA IDs are generated by including a sequential postfix to the Sample ID, e.g. water sample H2O20-0001's provisional publication will be IDd H2O20-0001-COA01 and final publication H2O20-0001-COA02. The COA ID is also used in the actual PDF's title, e.g. H2O20-0001-COA02.pdf and also displayed in the Reports listings, per Sample and Client

Multiple Samples

As more than one Sample’s results are represented, the Sample ID cannot be used as the root for the COA ID. Though the Samples might belong to the same Batch, that is not always true, and using Batch ID will be wrong

The multi-sample COA gets a simple ID server driven sequential ID that can be configured in the ID server to e.g. a prefix COA followed by the year and sequence number. E.g. COA21-0001, COA21-0002, etc. If the Client IDs in the data are meaningful, they too can be included. The COA ID format remains configurable, exactly like the others, and all of the others IDs, in the ID server accessible through the LIMS setup pages

The COA ID is also used in the actual PDF and CSV's titles, e.g. COA21-0001.pdf, COA21-0001.csv,  and also displayed in the Reports listings, per Sample and Client
