Improvements to the default Senaite COA templates following ISO 17025 (2017) guidelines

Some of the improvements here should rightfully be submitted to Senaite as it improves the generic tempplates. The add-on is sponsored by [Test It laboratory](https://www.testit-labs.co.za/) member of the [Bika Open Source Collective](https://www.bikalims.org/), coded by [Bika Lab Systems](https://www.bikalabs.com/), and not enough capacity currently exists to complete the procedure, hopefully sooner than later

Improvements include:

### Unique ID per COA

More than one COA may be issued for the same Samples, say for provisional publication of early results and republication when all results are available. For this reason COA’s must have unique IDs to refer to them correctly

COA IDs are generated by including a sequential postfix to the Sample ID, e.g. water sample H2O20-0001's provisional publication will be IDd H2O20-0001-COA01 and final publication H2O20-0001-COA02. The COA ID is also used in the actual PDF's title, e.g. H2O20-0001-COA02.pdf and also displayed in the Reports listings, per Sample and Client

Multiple Samples

As more than one Sample’s results are represented, the Sample ID cannot be used as the root for the COA ID. Though the Samples might belong to the same Batch, that is not always true, and using Batch ID will be wrong

The multi-sample COA gets a simple ID server driven sequential ID that can be configured in the ID server to e.g. a prefix COA followed by the year and sequence number. E.g. COA21-0001, COA21-0002, etc. If the Client IDs in the data are meaningful, they too can be included. The COA ID format remains configurable, exactly like the others, and all of the others IDs, in the ID server accessible through the LIMS setup pages

The COA ID is also used in the actual PDF and CSV's titles, e.g. COA21-0001.pdf, COA21-0001.csv, and also displayed in the Reports listings, per Sample and Client

### Subcontracting

Labs sometimes subcontract Analyses and ISO requires these be indicated on the COA, without any details. Methods are subcontracted and not Analysis Services. Methods get an additional attribute, tagged Subcontracted to and to be populated from the Suppliers set up in the system

For the COA, a result’s Method is inspected, and if the contracted to field is populated, the results is indicated with the Supplier icon. No other information about the subcontracting has to be displayed

### Results CSVs

Multi Sample results publication includes a CSV of results that is also attached to the outgoing emails

***

The rest of the COA templates, for single and multiple samples, follow ISO principles with regards to applying Specification, e.g.

If a result’s Method is subcontracted, it  is indicated with the Supplier icon 

If the Analysis has lower and upper detention limits (LDL, UDL) configured, and the result value is smaller that the LDL, the results itself is not displayed, but ‘< LDL’, e.g. < 0.05. Ditto for values bigger than the UDL, ‘> UDL’, e.g. > 125.00

If it has a Measure of Uncertainty configured, the uncertainty value is calculated and displayed  with a ‘±’ sign in the column just to the right of the value

results uncertainties and report signatories and end of report statement with icon legend and terms and conditions. Positioning and size of accreditation logo is taken into account in the COA header
